# AdventOfCode2019
This are my attempts at solving the AdventOfCode2019 puzzles. These attempts are all done in Python.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I am using Advent Of Code to learn and practise coding.
